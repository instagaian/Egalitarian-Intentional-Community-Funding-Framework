# Egalitarian-Intentional-Community-Funding-Framework

## Egalitarian
Egalitarian, meaning that is is as fair as possible and is designed to prevent discrimination, corruption, loss of trust and division which can arise once money/fiat/survival-tokens are involved in intentional communities. Politically as neutral as possible, it does not reward competitive behaviour but aims to sustain members who dedicate their life energy. On the other side it does not permit any member to have special privileges based on their life circumstances instead it creates the conditions for other members to gift within the community on a peer to peer basis.

## Intentional
Intentional, meaning that community does not exist just to survive, but has a purpose and ethos to assist the world in progressing into increasing dimensions of sustainability and technological advancements that lead to us becoming an interstellar life propagating symbiotic species.

## Community
Community meaning a co-creative group of people with strong social bonds and a shared vision. A physical presence at a shared location (base/hub) is necessary to meet requirements for social ties and qualification for any shared income.

## notice
The framework has not to my knowledge been tested and is subject to change, variations that adhere to the main ethos and tenants are welcome
